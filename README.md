# music-instrument-recognizer
Musical Instruments Recognition based on MFCC and kNN

The project was developed for the Microprocessor Architecture course, at Applied Electronics specialization of TUCN. 
The implementation is based on the project found at https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-project-music-genre-classification/?ref=morioh.com&utm_source=morioh.com.
The Documentation is included separately, containing all the References and important aspects.

The dataset was build from files from Philharmonia UK website, from the MARSYSAS website and from personal recordings.

I do not own any copyright for the project. I made this public post in order to help future students, if they want to choose an audio classifier topic for a project.
